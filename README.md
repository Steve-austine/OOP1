The challenge is to create a dart program that has the following features:

An object-oriented model that uses classes and inheritance
A class that implements an interface
A class that overrides an inherited method
A method that demonstrates the use of a loop

This program defines:

An interface Vehicle with start() and stop() methods.
A base class Automobile representing common attributes of vehicles.
A class Car that implements the Vehicle interface and inherits from Automobile. It overrides the displayInfo() method and implements start() and stop() methods.
In the main() function, it creates a Car instance, displays car information, demonstrates a loop, and starts and stops the car.
